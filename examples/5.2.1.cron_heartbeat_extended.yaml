  This DAG extends the basic cron heartbeat by adding additional informational tasks executed at every scheduled interval. The pipeline logs a heartbeat message, performs lightweight environment checks, and prints a summary. It is designed to test recurring execution, repeated logging consistency, and stable behavior in cron-driven workflows.

dag:
  name: "cron_heartbeat_extended"
  cron_schedule: "*/10 * * * *"  # Each 10 minutes

  tasks:
    # 1) Initial message to check the start
    - task_id: "heartbeat_start"
      type: "PrintTask"
      params:
        message: "Heartbeat: Maestro cron job triggered."
      dependencies: []

    # 2) System check
    - task_id: "bash_info"
      type: "BashTask"
      params:
        command: "echo 'Time:' $(date); echo 'PWD:' $(pwd)"
      dependencies: ["heartbeat_start"]

    # 3) Final message
    - task_id: "heartbeat_end"
      type: "PrintTask"
      params:
        message: "Heartbeat extended: basic info logged."
